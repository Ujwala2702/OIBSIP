Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship
✅ Task 1 –🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of my Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte, with the goal of building a predictive model to classify Iris flowers into one of three species based on their morphological measurements.

📝 Problem Statement:
The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 flowers from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The task is to train a machine learning model to classify flowers based on:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – ML model building & evaluation

🛠️ Key Components
Data Exploration & Visualization:

Analyzed the distribution of features using histograms, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps

Identified relationships between features and class labels

Preprocessing:

Normalized data using StandardScaler

Split dataset into training and testing sets

Model Building:

Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression

Achieved a maximum accuracy of 97% on the test set

Evaluation:

Used confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score for performance assessment

📊 Visual Outputs
Pair plots of features to show cluster separation

Heatmap showing feature correlations

Confusion matrix for each model

💡 Learning Outcomes
Learned how to work with a classic dataset and apply supervised classification

Practiced data visualization to derive insights from feature relationships

Understood model evaluation metrics and algorithm comparison

Improved knowledge of KNN, Decision Trees, and logistic models
