 Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship
✅ Task 4 – 📧 Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning
This project was developed during my Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The objective was to build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying emails as spam or not spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

📝 Problem Statement
Build a robust email classifier that can:

Identify spam (unwanted/malicious) emails

Reduce false positives and improve email filtering accuracy

Learn from labeled datasets and generalize to new, unseen emails

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data processing

NLTK, Scikit-learn – NLP and machine learning

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualizations

🛠️ Key Components
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned text by removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters

Applied tokenization, stemming, and lowercase conversion

Feature Extraction:

Transformed text into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorization

Model Building:

Trained multiple classifiers: Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression

Used train-test split and cross-validation to ensure generalizability

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Final model achieved ~98.2% accuracy with excellent recall on spam detection

📊 Visualization Highlights
Spam vs Ham distribution

Confusion matrix heatmap

Word cloud of most common spam terms

💡 Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Learned to implement and evaluate text classification models

Understood the importance of feature extraction methods like TF-IDF

Practiced performance tuning to reduce false positives in spam classification
