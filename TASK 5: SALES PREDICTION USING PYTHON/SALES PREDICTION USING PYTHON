Oasi s Infobyte Data Science Internship
✅ Task 5 – 💰 Sales  Prediction using Machine Learning
This project was developed under the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship, focusing on predicting product sales using machine learning techniques. The primary objective was to analyze marketing spend and other influencing factors to accurately forecast sales and help in data-driven decision-making for future business planning.

📝 Problem Statement
Sales forecasting plays a critical role in business strategy. The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts sales volume based on various independent features such as:

Advertising budget

Marketing channel (TV, Radio, Newspaper)

Product category or region (if available)

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model training & evaluation

Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor

🛠️ Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers

Scaled and normalized features for better model performance

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized sales trends using bar plots and scatter plots

Investigated correlations between features and target variable

Model Building & Evaluation:

Built multiple regression models and compared them

Used metrics like R² Score, MAE, and RMSE to evaluate performance

Best model achieved high accuracy and generalization on test data

📈 Results & Visualizations
Achieved reliable prediction performance using Random Forest Regressor

Plotted actual vs predicted sales for visual comparison

Showed feature importance to interpret key sales drivers

💡 Key Learnings
Understood regression modeling in real-world business applications

Gained experience in feature engineering and data visualization

Learned to evaluate and tune models for better accuracy

Improved understanding of how marketing inputs impact sales outcomes
