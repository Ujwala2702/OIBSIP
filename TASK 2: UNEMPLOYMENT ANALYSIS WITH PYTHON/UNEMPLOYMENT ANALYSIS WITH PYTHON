Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship
✅ Task 2 – 📉 Unemployment Analysis with Python
This project was developed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. It involves analyzing unemployment trends in India using Python, with a focus on understanding the regional impact during and after the COVID-19 pandemic through effective data visualization and interpretation.

📌 Problem Statement
To analyze unemployment data in India by:

Identifying unemployment trends across various regions and timeframes

Visualizing how unemployment rates shifted during critical phases like the pandemic

Drawing insights to support policy recommendations or further research

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Components
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, reformatted dates, and categorized regions for easier comparison.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns and outliers using bar graphs, line charts, and heatmaps.

Visualization: Created insightful plots to showcase regional unemployment trends, including:

Month-over-month unemployment rates

State-wise comparisons

Gender-wise unemployment trends (if applicable)

Insights & Reporting: Highlighted economic zones with highest/lowest unemployment, and COVID-19’s direct impact on labor.

📈 Sample Visuals
📌 Line Chart: Trend of unemployment over time

📌 Heatmap: Regional unemployment severity

📌 Bar Chart: Top states by unemployment rate

💡 Learning Outcomes
Gained experience in working with real-world socio-economic datasets

Strengthened skills in data wrangling and visual storytelling using Python

Understood how to draw actionable insights from structured time-series data

Developed a clear, communicable narrative for public-facing reports
