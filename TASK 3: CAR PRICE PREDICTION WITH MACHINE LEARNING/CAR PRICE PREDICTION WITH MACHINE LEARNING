Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship
✅ Task 3 – 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
This project is part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I worked on predicting car prices using various machine learning algorithms. The objective was to build a regression model that could accurately estimate the price of a car based on multiple influencing features.

📌 Problem Statement
To develop a predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on:

Engine capacity, fuel type, and transmission

Brand, model, mileage, and age of the car

Owner type and other categorical/numerical features

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – ML algorithms and evaluation

🛠️ Key Components
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers

Encoded categorical variables (Brand, Fuel, etc.)

Normalized numerical data for better model performance

Feature Engineering:

Derived new features like car age

Removed multicollinearity among features

Model Building:

Implemented Linear Regression, Ridge, and Random Forest Regression 

Compared models using R² Score, MAE, and RMSE

Model Evaluation:

Final model achieved an R² score of 0.89

Conducted residual analysis and performance plotting

📈 Visual Outputs
Correlation heatmap

Feature importance bar chart

Actual vs Predicted price scatter plot

💡 Learning Outcomes
Understood end-to-end regression modeling for real-world data

Gained expertise in data wrangling, feature selection, and model tuning

Learned how to handle categorical variables effectively

Developed confidence in interpreting and communicating model results
